# Confluence Link Share extension

This extension provides a button that allows you to share links in Confluence.

This is an alternative to the bookmarklet that you can place in the bookmarks toolbar.
Personally, I keep my bookmark toolbar hidden for screen estate.

Currently the Confluence URL is hardcoded to devopsguys.atlassian.net.

## Installing

1. Download this repo as a zip file, unzip it somewhere.
2. Browse to chrome://extensions
3. Drag the unzipped folder into the browser window

## Usage

There will be a new icon in your extensions bar (right of the address bar).

When you find a webpage that you want to share, click the icon.

## Going forward...

* Add an options page to remove hardcoded Confluence URL
* Upload to the Chrome extensions store
