# Confluence Link Share extension

This extension provides a button that allows you to share links in Confluence.

This is an alternative to the bookmarklet that you can place in the bookmarks toolbar.
Personally, I keep my bookmark toolbar hidden for more screen estate.

The default Confluence URL is https://devopsguys.atlassian.net but this can be changed in the Options page.

The extension can be installed from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/share-to-confluence/pfcikaphgbfgnjkiicgcilekiggjmfaj?authuser=0)

## Installing manually

1. Download this repo as a zip file, unzip it somewhere.
2. Browse to chrome://extensions
3. Drag the unzipped folder into the browser window

## Usage

There will be a new icon in your extensions bar (right of the address bar).

When you find a webpage that you want to share, click the icon.
